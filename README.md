# ComfyUI Segment Queue Runner

# [简体中文](README_CN.md) 

An automated long-video generation node for ComfyUI Wan Animate / KJ Context, supporting segmented generation, seamless transitions, auto scene switching, breakpoint resuming, auto merging, and audio sync.

## ✨ Key Features
- Segmented Generation: Automatically split long videos to avoid out-of-memory errors
- Seamless Transitions: Use last frame of previous segment for smooth continuity
- Auto Scene Switch: Support multi-reference images for style/character changes
- Breakpoint Resume: Continue from any segment after interruption
- Auto Merge: Automatically combine clips into a complete video
- Audio Sync: Auto-extract and align audio from source video
- Preview Mode: Check segment plan before rendering

## 📦 Installation
cd ComfyUI/custom_nodes

git clone https://github.com/FX-FeiHou/Comfyui-Segment-Queue-Runner.git

## 📢 Changelog

### [v2.4] - 2026-04-06
**Core Update: Adaptive Enhancement & UI/UX Optimization**
- **ComfyUI Port Auto-Recognition**: Automatically adapt to local usage and remote calls (RH adaptation pending KJ's wrapper node merge)
- **UI Style Unification**: Modified and unified the style of partial button UI elements
- **Execution Mode Highlight**: Added edge highlight distinction for execution modes, with toggle switch in settings
- **Slider UI for Segmentation**: Replaced segment count/start segment input with draggable sliders, optimized maximum segment count settings for better usability
- **Native Popup Optimization**: Removed redundant built-in selectors, only retained Windows (local) or browser (remote) native popups for selecting images/videos
- **Reference Image Management**: 
  - Drag to sort selected reference images (hold left click)
  - Remove images (right click)
  - Duplicate images (left click) to reuse the same image multiple times (no need to replace images for unchanged scenes/styles)
- **File Naming Optimization**: Replaced random run identifiers in `sqr_cut_*`/`sqr_trans_*`/`sqr_merged_*` with sortable timestamps (time code format), maintaining anti-overwrite capability while improving file identification; breakpoint resume logic adapted accordingly
- **Dependency & Log Enhancement**: Added cv2 missing error logging, specified `opencv-python>=4.8` dependency

### [v2.0] - 2026-04-03
**Core Update: Multi-Task Parallel Queue Support**
- **New Task Queue**: Support for simultaneous submission of multiple generation tasks.
- **Random Interleaved Sampling**: Implemented random interleaved sampling logic between different tasks.
- **Dynamic Priority Merging**: "First-finished, first-merged" strategy to optimize workflow.

**Bug Fixes:**
- **Fixed Preview Error**: Resolved the issue where previews in the image selection box displayed incorrectly.
- **Fixed Segment Misalignment**: Corrected the potential misalignment between segmented samples during multi-task parallel processing.
- **Fixed Video Overwriting**: Resolved a critical bug where final video merges could be overwritten during multi-task execution.

## 🚀 Quick Start
1. Connect frame_count and fps from Load Video to this node
2. Set segment count, turn off Run to preview the plan first
3. Bind nodes via buttons:
   - Source Video Node (Load Video)
   - Output Node (VHS_VideoCombine)
   - Motion Embedding Node (WanVideoAnimateEmbeds)
4. Turn on Run to start automatic generation

## 🛠 Modes
- Preview: Show segment plan only, no rendering
- New Generation: Render from segment 1 and auto-merge
- Resume: Continue from interrupted video seamlessly

## 📌 FAQ
- Node ID empty: Bind required nodes using the on-node buttons
- Resume after interruption: Set start segment → select last video → enable resume → run
- Output path: output/sqr_merged_xxx.mp4
- ffmpeg missing: Install ffmpeg and add to system PATH
